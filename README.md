# KBTU_OPEN_2019

Task String merging

time limit per test:	second

memory limit per test:	megabytes

input:	standard input

output:	standard output

In this problem you will be given two strings - A and B.

Your task is to find a string C such that it contains both A and B as substring and it will be shortest among all possible strings.

A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. So, string {kbtu} is substring of string {kbtu open},
but string {fall} is not.

Input Format:
The first line of the input will contain string A 1≤∣A∣≤10^5

The second line of the input will contains string B 1≤∣B∣≤10^5

It is guaranteed that both strings will contain only lowercase Latin letters.

Output Format:
Print one string - C

Examples: 
Example 1 {A = compressing, B = single, C = compressingle}
Example 2 {A = hi, B = you, C = hiyou}
